<p>AI has been deployed to make our lives better too. AI experiments composing original compositions from books to music, developing recipes based on what's currently in the cupboard and even creating art works extend AI 's influence over our lives. The AI-powered recommendation engines from Netflix and Spotify help streamline our decision-making process when we are looking for the next show to watch or song to listen to. If we removed AI, it's obvious that our world would look vastly different in every way. As current investments and research lead to expanded and perfected use of AI, we can expect the technology to get even more entangled in our everyday lives, workplaces and society. Reasoning deals with cognitive functions of a higher level such as planning, drawing inferential conclusions from a world model, diagnosing, designing, etc. Communication deals with the problem of understanding and passing on information by using language. Finally, Learning handles the problem of automatically improving system performance over time, based on the experience of the system. A lot of important technical concepts originated from A.I. That unifies these diverse problem areas and forms the basis for scientific discipline. Overall, A.I. Systems function on the basis of a Knowledge Base of facts and rules characterizing the competency domain of the system. The elements of a Knowledge Base are independently valid chunks of information (or at least plausible ones). The system has to organize and use this information automatically to solve the particular problems it encounters. Generally speaking, this organization process can be characterized as a search for specific goals. The search is made complex by the need to determine the relevance of the information and by the frequent occurrence of uncertain and ambiguous information. Heuristics deliver the A.I. System with a mechanism to focus the attention and control the search processes. The A.I. organization necessarily adaptable. Systems provide A.I. requirement The Architectures of Computation. Within such an architecture all the knowledge the system uses must be represented. Real-world knowledge acquisition and encoding into A.I .. Architecture encompasses the Knowledge Engineering subfield.</p>
